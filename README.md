# 🧠 Project Title: Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts customer churn with the goal of improving retention strategies.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Project Description
In this project, I analyzed a customer dataset to identify key factors that lead to customer churn. After preprocessing the data and performing exploratory analysis, I trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models. The final model achieved an **83% accuracy rate**, enabling targeted customer retention efforts.

## 🔍 Key Steps
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering
4. Model selection and evaluation (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
5. Final model deployment (local demo or inference script)

## 📈 Results
- Final model accuracy: **83%**
- Key insights:
  - Contract length and service issues are strong indicators of churn
  - Monthly charges play a significant role in retention risk
